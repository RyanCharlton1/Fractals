# Mandelbrot Set
The set of $c$ for which the repeated application of  function $f(z) = z^2 + c$ does not diverge. The screen will represent the 2D complex plane with $x$ being real and $y$ imaginary, each pixel $c\in\Complex$, $c =x + yi$ will be used as the constant in $f(z)$, the amount of interations or "escape time" until divergance will be used to colour the pixel.
