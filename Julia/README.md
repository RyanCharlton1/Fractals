# Julia Set
A modified Mandelbrot set, the only change made is that in the Mandelbrot set the $c$ in $z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c$ is the complex number that the current pixel represents and $z_0 = 0 + 0i$, however in the Julia set $z_0$ is the current pixel's complex number and the $c$ is a user chosen prameter.
